# Featured Extended Team Automata (FETA)

FETA is a formalism to reason about communication safety in families (or software product lines) of teams,
which are systems of reactive components that communicate according 
to specified synchronisation types.

This repository provides a prototype tool to specify and analysis FETA. 
Currently, it is possible to try the tool online at [http://arcatools.org/feta]()
